## 2. Role Behavior Summary

| Role | Can Upload Products? | Can Sell? | Needs Approval? | Sees Prices |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Retail Customer** | ❌ No | ❌ No (buys only) | No | Retail Price |
| **Wholesale Customer** | ❌ No | ❌ No (buys only) | ✅ Yes, by Admin | Wholesale Price + Schemes |
| **Admin** | ✅ Yes | — (manages everything) | — (single account) | Sees all |

> Not a marketplace (unlike Daraz/OLX) — only Admin lists products. Both customer types can only purchase.

## 3. Branch & Warehouse (Godam) Structure

Each branch is fully self-contained and includes its own **warehouse (godam)**:

```
Branch (e.g. Branch A)
│
├── Warehouse / Godam         ← physical stock storage for this branch
│   ├── Stock List
│   ├── Minimum Stock Alerts
│   └── Stock Transfer (to/from other branches' godams)
│
├── Sales
├── Purchases
├── Customers
├── Suppliers
├── Expenses
├── Cash
└── Bank
```

Admin can view each branch's godam individually, **or** see combined stock across all branches/godams from one dashboard.

## 4. Core Workflows

### Retail Flow
```
Home → Retail Shop → Browse Products → Add to Cart → Checkout
     → Order Placed → Status Tracking → WhatsApp Confirmation
```

### Wholesale Flow
```
Home → Wholesale Login → (First time?) → Registration Form
     → Status: Pending → Admin Reviews → Accept / Reject
     → (If Accepted) Login → Dashboard → Wholesale Prices + Schemes
     → Quick Order / Cart → Checkout → Ledger Updated → WhatsApp Confirmation
```

### Admin Flow
```
Home → Admin Login → Dashboard
     → Manage Products → Manage Branches & Godams
     → Approve/Reject Wholesale Requests
     → Track Orders (Retail + Wholesale separately)
     → Manage Customer & Supplier Ledgers
     → View Aging Reports
     → Generate Reports (Excel/PDF export)
```

## 5. Key Business Rules

- **Schemes**: e.g. "10+1" = buy 10 units, get 1 free — set by Admin per product, auto-applied at checkout.
- **Ledger (Khata)**: tracks Debit (customer buys → owes more) vs Credit (customer pays → owes less), running balance per customer/supplier.
- **Aging Reports**: shows how many days a payment has been outstanding (0–7 / 8–15 / 16–27 / 28+ days) for customers, and due/overdue days for suppliers.
- **Supplier Location**: stored as address/location on file (one-time capture, like a location-permission popup) — **not** continuous live GPS tracking.
- **Payments**: Phase 1 is manual entry only (cash/bank/cheque) — online gateway (JazzCash/Easypaisa) blocked for now due to merchant account approval difficulty for small businesses.
- **WhatsApp**: via official Business API (Twilio/Gupshup/Wati) — has its own separate recurring monthly cost, not included in dev fee.
- **Admin Access**: single shared login only — no separate staff roles (Branch Manager, Sales Staff, etc.) in this scope.

## 6. Open Items to Confirm with Client

- [ ] AI search — get 2–3 real example queries from client before building
- [ ] WhatsApp API provider — which one, who pays the monthly subscription
- [ ] Does retail registration also need admin approval, or wholesale only?
- [ ] Existing product data to migrate, or starting fresh?
- [ ] Branding assets (logo, colors, reference content)

## 7. Phases (from Proposal)

| Phase | Scope | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Core website + retail/wholesale ordering + basic admin | 1–2 weeks |
| Phase 2 | Multi-branch (incl. godam), ledger, aging reports, full reporting | 2–3 weeks |
| Phase 3 | WhatsApp API, AI search, testing, handover | 1–2 weeks |

**Total: 5–7 weeks**
